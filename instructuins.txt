And abide by the following requirements:
● Optimized to render large data sets
○ It should be possible to feed the table a data set of 2000 rows (or more) with 10
(or more) columns without being slow

○ We will try to feed our own columns and data sets (in the same shape provided
below) and everything should work as expected
